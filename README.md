# IMDB Watchlist

A small and dirty hack that downloads your IMDB watchlist, cross-references with JustWatch and the Bechdel API and allows you to sort the result.

The idea was to be able to efficiently answer the questions - which movie should we watch next.

This is a hack. It is makes a lot of requests, only uses private APIs and is probably not sanctioned by any of the above parties. It shouldn't cause huge issues but please be careful if you decide to use this for your private use.
